#### The "Golden Age" of video games for many was when arcade games were what kids spent countless hours on, with games like Pac-Man, Space Invaders, and Galaga. I wanted to bring the arcade kind of feel to my game while adding a new sort of touch to it, getting my inspiration from old games like the ones my dad used to play
